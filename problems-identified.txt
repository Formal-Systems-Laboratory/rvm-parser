1. current rv-monitor for c part only supports one pair of property and handler 
in one spec.

the part for java is better, but the generated code does not compile due to
re-define some vars in the same runtime monitor function (the method in which 
event dispatching occurs).

***
In fact, even if the compile-time errors are corrected, the generated code for
multi-properties spec is still incorrect.

The transition functions for each property can be generated, but
the monitor is not keeping track of the states of multiple fsm.
It only keeps track of a single current state, which is not 
the combination of states for each fsm, no matter how many
properties you have.
