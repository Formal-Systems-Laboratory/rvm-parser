1. develop a template of c program.
2. rewrite the template to real c code string.

3. handle the case where multiple formulas are inside one spec.

For each property, there will be a matrix of integers encoding the transition functions.

Each row of the matrix encodes an event transition function, and the row number is the index of the corresponding event.

So for each property, we can simple keep a matrix and two string arrays (one for events and one for states).

***
P.S. Need to consider the corner cases:
a) A defined event never occurs inside the formula.

b) Undefined event occurs in the formula.

c) Duplicate definitions for events/states.

d) Undefined state in the formula.
